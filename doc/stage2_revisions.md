-0.5: I see some "double line" tables in your UML diagram which isn't standard in UML. That notation is used in ER diagrams to represent weak-entities, but since your diagram is in UML and those entities aren't weak, not sure why they are marked with double lines. 


-2: You have to specify in your schema what attribute your foreign keys are referencing as mentioned in the assignment description:

Your relational schema should be formatted as follows:
Table-Name(Column1:Domain [PK], Column2:Domain
"


changes:


1. deleted the double lines from the tables in UML diagram
2. Changed the relational schema to the format: "Table-Name(Column1:Domain [PK], Column2:Domain"

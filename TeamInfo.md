## Project Summary

We develop a game similar to Fantasy Football but for Spotify artists. Each artist will have a price that you can sign them. Users will be given a “budget” of 100 million to sign 5 artists. Every month, we assign points for each artist based on Spotify performance and users get however many points their chosen artists earned.
